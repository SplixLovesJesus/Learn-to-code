    This actually uses my breading for Chicken Fried Steak---my husband suggested we try it with chicken breasts, and it was delicious!

        Fry chicken in the hot oil for about 5 minutes per side, or until the chicken is cooked through and juices run clear. Remove from the oil with a slotted spatula, and serve.
